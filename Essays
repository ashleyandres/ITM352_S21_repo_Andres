Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details

So basically Assignment 2 required us to make a login and registration page. This made us creat validation and restriction for users when creating their profile as a new users and we also had to store their information in a database so that we can use their information in the future, for example when they have to log back in again, we can verify they are already a user by matching up data in our database. We also had to personalize our invocie page, and we were able to do so because we already had a file that had the usernames information. In assignment 2 we also had to make sure our pages flow across other pages, which basically meant we had to put atleast some sort of navbar in there.

What did you learn from this assignment?

That it is possible to figure out things on my own if I just utilized my resources. There was one point where my server was completley not communicating with my form and it took me about a whole day to realize that my end tag was not in the right place, so everything that was in my form was not able to work on the server. I learned that debugging is an important practice. Even though we kind of skimmed over it in class, I felt like if I had just debugged the program instead of being stubborn and wanting to figure everything out myself, I could have literally saved myself time a whole lot of headache.

Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).
100% Me

How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
So for this assignment, I wanted to do it on my own and tried not to ask for help. I heavily relied on watching the screen casts and during desperate moments, looked at other people's codes as inspiration for validation(cause like why would I try to invent the wheel when it's already invented, you know what I mean). I caved in when I could not get my form to work. I had a limit for myself if I was not able to solve a problem by Monday, I would ask for help. 

How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
In Assignment #1 I lacked a lot of confidence and would rely on Professor Port's office hours to get what needed to be done through the Office Hours. It kind of hurted my pride that I was not able to figure stuff out myself. So instead of being dependent, I was really independent for Assignment#2. I was able to first think things through before making code. For example, for the logiin page, I had to plan out what I wanted this particlar page to do and how the other pages would interact with it. I also had the funtions of the page, like the buttons and the types of buttons they would be. I did plan while I was coding though, so I kind of did wing it the whole time. It did worked out in the end, but some of my indecisivness cost me atleast a days worth of work.

Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
I can't actually give an actual estimates, since for this Assignment#2, I kind of planned along the way and as we were going through the labs, I made mental notes on what codes I could use for the Assignment and go back on the screencast when I was formulating code in my Assignment #2. Again, my indecisivness did cost me a lot of time, however I did know what I wanted each page to do. It was just the matter of how I would desing the page and where to put code was the difficult part. If I could give an overall estimate, I would say, maybe 2 hours worth of thinking.

Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
Designing the login and registration pages were a lot easier than creating my other pages. I find that using a template is a lot easier and that there are ways that I can change the design using another person's template. What did not work well was, well I basically did not use the debugger, which was a huge mistake on my part. I should have used the additional tools that could have helped me find mistakes faster than my own two eyes. This could have literally saved me a whole days works and I could have designed my website better.

If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
I would go back to Assignment #1 and used a tempalte instead of trying to copy bits and pieces of other people's templates. That was just a pain, but atleast now I know how to use CSS confidently now. I would also utilize the debugger, which I will use for Assignment #3 since we are using sessions and cookies and since they are going to be working on multiple pages, I need be tedious on how the code is implented
